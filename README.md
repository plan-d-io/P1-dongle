# P1-dongle
ESP32-based firmware and hardware to receive, parse, store and forward energy data coming from the P1 port of Fluvius digital meters (Flanders, Belgium). Should also work on Dutch, Walloon, Luxembourg and Swedish digital meters (untested).

- Privacy first: cloud, or even internet access entirely optional
- Auto-updating firmware (optional)
- Easy to use as a basis for other (professional) projects

I do not provide any guarantees nor timelines for developing functionality. I am however available for specific functionality or developments at request. 
And, as this is an open-source project, you are free to contribute yourself!
